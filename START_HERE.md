**60 days to production**

- Week 1-2: Integration + setup

- Week 5-8: Scale to production
- Week 9-12: Full automation

### "What's the catch?"

**There isn't one, but here's what to know:**
- Crypto adoption starts at 5-10% (grows over time)
- Agent autonomy requires good policies (we help)
- Integration takes 2-4 weeks (we do it for you)

### "How is this different from Stripe?"

**Stripe**: Payment processor only, 2.9% fees
**Us**: Payments (0.5%) + AI automation

**Stripe can't:**

- Handle subscription changes autonomously
- Eliminate chargebacks

**We do all of that.**

### "How is this different from Zendesk?"

**Zendesk**: Human-in-loop CS tool
**Us**: Fully autonomous AI agents

**Zendesk requires:**
