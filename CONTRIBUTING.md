```

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please include:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a step-by-step description** of the suggested enhancement
- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps
- **Describe the current behavior** and explain which behavior you expected to see instead
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these issues:

- Issues labeled `good first issue` - issues which should only require a few lines of code
- Issues labeled `help wanted` - issues which need extra attention
- Issues labeled `documentation` - improvements or additions to documentation

### Pull Requests

1. **Create a topic branch** from where you want to base your work
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clear, concise commit messages
   - Include tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Follow the style guidelines** (see below)

4. **Ensure all tests pass**
   ```bash
   cargo test
   cargo clippy -- -D warnings
   cargo fmt --check
   ```

5. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request

6. **PR Guidelines:**
   - Fill in the required template
   - Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
   - Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible
   - End all files with a newline

## Development Process

### Branch Organization

- `main` - stable release branch
- `develop` - main development branch
- `feature/*` - feature branches
- `fix/*` - bug fix branches
- `release/*` - release preparation branches

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- `refactor:` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` - Performance improvement
- `test:` - Adding missing tests
- `chore:` - Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(orders): add bulk order import endpoint
fix(inventory): correct stock level calculation
docs(api): update authentication examples
```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Maintain or increase code coverage
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Test error cases, not just happy paths

Example test:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_create_order() {
        // Arrange
        let db = setup_test_db().await;
        let service = OrderService::new(db);
        
        // Act
        let order = service.create_order(/* ... */).await;
        
        // Assert
        assert!(order.is_ok());
        assert_eq!(order.unwrap().status, OrderStatus::Pending);
    }
}
```

## Style Guidelines

### Rust Style

We use `rustfmt` and `clippy` to maintain consistent code style:

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check linting
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

**Key guidelines:**
- Use descriptive variable names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Document public APIs with doc comments
- Use `Result<T, E>` for error handling
- Prefer `&str` over `String` for function parameters
- Use `Arc<T>` for shared ownership across threads

### API Design

- Follow RESTful principles
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Version APIs appropriately (`/api/v1/`)
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Include helpful error messages

### Documentation

- Document all public functions and types
- Include examples in doc comments
- Keep README.md up to date
- Document breaking changes

Example:
```rust
/// Creates a new order with the specified items.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `customer_id` - The ID of the customer placing the order
/// * `items` - Vector of items to include in the order
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let order = create_order(customer_id, vec![item1, item2]).await?;
/// ```
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns `OrderError::InvalidCustomer` if the customer doesn't exist.
pub async fn create_order(
    customer_id: Uuid,
    items: Vec<OrderItem>
) -> Result<Order, OrderError> {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Database Schema

- Use migrations for all schema changes
- Name tables in plural form (e.g., `orders`, `customers`)
- Use `snake_case` for column names
- Include timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`)
- Add appropriate indexes

## Pull Request Process

   - Rebase on the latest `main` branch
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Update documentation if needed

   - At least one maintainer approval required
   - All CI checks must pass
   - No merge conflicts
   - Conversations resolved
