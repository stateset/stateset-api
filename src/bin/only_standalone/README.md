# Stateset API Minimal Runner

This is a minimal working executable that can be run while the main Stateset API codebase is being fixed.

## How to Run

```bash
# Change to this directory
cd src/bin/only_standalone

# Run the standalone binary
cargo run
```

## API Endpoints
- `GET /` - Welcome message
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /counter` - Get the current counter value
- `POST /counter` - Increment the counter

## Progress on Fixing the Main API

We've made several improvements to fix the main API codebase:

### 1. ✅ Model Structs Issue (PARTIALLY FIXED)
- Fixed some SeaORM's `DeriveEntityModel` requirement that the struct must be named `Model`
- Fixed naming conflicts in:
  - work_order.rs (renamed WorkOrderLineItem to Model)
  - warranty.rs (fixed range validators on Decimal fields)
  - warranty_line_item.rs (fixed range validators on Decimal fields)

### 2. ⏳ Missing Entity Modules (PARTIALLY FIXED)
- Identified the missing entity modules referenced in imports
- Updated CLAUDE.md with documentation of what needs to be fixed

### 3. ⏳ Event System (PARTIALLY FIXED)
- Added missing event variants to the Event enum
- Updated EventSender to use mpsc instead of broadcast
- Fixed the process_events function

### 4. ⏳ Import Issues (PARTIALLY FIXED)
- Fixed duplicate OrderError definitions in several command files
- Added missing AppError type and conversions

### 5. ⏳ Database Connection (PARTIALLY FIXED)
- Added connect function to db.rs
- Fixed the main.rs to use the new connect function

### 6. ❌ Missing Commands (NOT FIXED YET)
- Many command implementations are still missing or incomplete

## Next Steps

To continue fixing the API:
1. Create a separate module for each entity model to avoid naming conflicts
2. Add implementations for the `inc()` method on IntCounter for metrics
3. Fix entity import/usage with proper syntax (e.g., Entity as EntityName)
4. Fix database connection pool access in queries
5. Implement missing command modules

The standalone binary provides a working API server while the main codebase is being fixed.
