# StateSet API Testing Summary

## Current Status

We have successfully tested the StateSet API using the `minimal-server` implementation, which provides mock data for development and testing purposes.

## Running Server

- **Server**: `minimal-server` 
- **Port**: 8080
- **Status**: âœ… Running and healthy

## Available Endpoints

The following endpoints are currently available and returning mock data:

1. **Health Check**
   - `GET /health` - Returns server health status
   - Response: Server status, version, and timestamp

2. **API Information**
   - `GET /api/info` - Returns API metadata
   - Response: API name, version, description, and available endpoints

3. **Order Management**
   - `GET /api/v1/orders` - Lists sample orders
   - Response: 3 mock orders with different statuses (processing, shipped, delivered)

4. **Inventory Status**
   - `GET /api/v1/inventory` - Shows inventory levels
   - Response: 2 mock products with availability and warehouse information

5. **Shipment Tracking**
   - `GET /api/v1/shipments` - Tracks shipments
   - Response: 2 mock shipments with tracking numbers and status

## Demo Scripts Created

1. **`basic_api_test.sh`** - Tests all available endpoints
2. **`minimal_server_demo.sh`** - Showcases working endpoints with formatted output

## Key Findings

1. The original demo scripts (e.g., `ecommerce_checkout_flow.sh`) expect a full commerce API implementation with endpoints for:
   - Customer registration/login
   - Product catalog
   - Shopping cart management
   - Checkout process
   - Payment processing

2. The current `minimal-server` provides basic mock data suitable for:
   - API connectivity testing
   - Basic integration testing
   - Development UI mockups
   - API client development

3. For full functionality, you would need:
   - PostgreSQL database (as configured in `config/default.toml`)
   - Redis for caching
   - Complete implementation of commerce endpoints
   - Authentication system

## Next Steps

To run the full commerce demos:

1. Set up PostgreSQL and Redis
2. Run database migrations
3. Use `api_server` binary instead of `minimal-server`
4. Implement missing commerce endpoints
5. Update demo scripts to match actual API implementation

## Running the Tests

To test the current API:

```bash
# Ensure minimal-server is running
cd demos
./minimal_server_demo.sh
```

To stop the server:
```bash
pkill -f "minimal-server"
```
