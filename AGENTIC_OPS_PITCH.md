# Agentic Ops + StablePay: One-Page Pitch

## The 30-Second Pitch

**Enterprise retailers waste $4-6M annually on payment fees, chargebacks, and manual customer operations.**

We solve this with:
1. **StablePay**: Accept crypto (USDC/USDT) at 0.5% vs 2.9% card fees = 83% savings
2. **Agentic Ops**: AI agents automate returns, subscriptions, inventory = 70% CS cost reduction

**Result: $3-5M saved annually for $100M GMV brands. 60-day deployment.**

## The Wedge Strategy

### Phase 1: Cross-Border Stablecoin Payments (Month 1-2)

**Target:** Brands with 30%+ international sales

**Pain:** 2.9% card + 2% FX = 4.9% total cost on international

**Solution:** USDC/USDT payment option at checkout
- Customer pays in stablecoins (no FX)
- Merchant receives USD (instant)
- Total cost: 0.5%

**ROI Example:**
- $30M international sales
- Current cost: $1.47M (4.9%)
- StablePay cost: $150K (0.5%)
- **Savings: $1.32M**

**Implementation:** Shopify app or Salesforce cartridge, 2-week integration

### Phase 2: Autonomous Returns + Subscriptions (Month 3-4)

**Target:** Same customers (already integrated from Phase 1)

**Pain:** Manual CS consuming 20+ FTEs = $1.2M+

**Solution:** Deploy Returns + Subscription agents
- 80% autonomous resolution
- Instant response (<2 min)
- Crypto refunds (via StablePay)

**ROI:** Save $600K-$840K in CS costs (50-70% reduction)

**Implementation:** Webhook setup + policy workshop, 30-day pilot

### Phase 3: Full Suite (Month 5-6)

**Expand to:** Inventory, Procurement, Fraud, Recovery agents

**Result:** Complete commerce automation platform

## Competitive Positioning

### We're NOT:
- ❌ Just a payment processor (Stripe, Adyen)
- ❌ Just crypto acceptance (Coinbase Commerce, BitPay)
- ❌ Just CS automation (Zendesk, Gorgias)

### We ARE:
- ✅ Unified platform (payments + operations)
- ✅ Built for enterprise retail ($50M+ GMV)
- ✅ Crypto-native + traditional hybrid
- ✅ Fully autonomous agents (not human-in-loop)
- ✅ 60-day deployment (not 6-12 months)

---

## Business Model

### StablePay Revenue
- **0.5% of payment volume**
- Example: $100M GMV = $500K/year recurring

### Agentic Ops Revenue
- **Starter**: $2,999/month ($36K/year)
- **Growth**: $7,999/month ($96K/year)
- **Enterprise**: Custom (avg $200K/year)

### Setup Fees
- **$25K-$100K** one-time (covers integration + training)

### Total Revenue Per Customer
- **Year 1**: $500K (payments) + $96K (agents) + $50K (setup) = **$646K**
- **Year 2+**: $500K + $96K = **$596K recurring**

### Unit Economics
- CAC: $75K (6-month sales cycle, $150K quota)
- LTV: $2.4M (4-year average, 80% gross margin)
- **LTV:CAC = 32x**
